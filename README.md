##Project Description

__Mashed Potatoes__ is an Android app that composes dubstep from your call history and the sounds you assign to your contacts!

 It randomly mashes up the sounds to give you a unique track each time you run it... unless if you aren't a social butterfly.
 
 No musical talent required!
